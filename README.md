# Clueless' GNU Emacs config

## Additional Content
This config contains some custom themes I've made over my time using Emacs:\
`clueless-theme` is a copy of Jonathan Blow's livestreams theme.\
`compiler-theme` is also from Jonathan Blow's streams, used up until ~2017.\
`handmade-theme` is a copy of Casey Muratori's livestreams theme.


It also contains a work-in-progress major mode for **Joi**,
the programming language I'm currently designing.

## Windows Setup
A *HOME* variable is required for the default directory to work properly.\
To set it, create an environment variable called `HOME` pointing to `%UserProfile%`.
